  "description": "The Mile High Papua New Guinea beans are grown in part by the Arokara Cooperative––a plantation partner with firm beliefs in chemical-free coffee production and updates to their processes annually. The Mile High is grown on the outskirts of Kainantu, which is a town in the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea. Nearly 12,000 of Kainantu’s citizens depend on coffee processing to support their families, and as many as 60 assistants can be hired at one time. The farms sit at an altitude of 1,600 meters above sea level, and their sizes are modest. The Mile High beans are highly consistent and “clean” due to their washed nature––the cherries are de-pulped and hardly fermented. This way, any overbearing sweetness disappears. Cupping notes: Bright acidity and creamy body with notes of berries, caramel, malt, and citrus. Try before you buy with a 1/2lb sample!!
