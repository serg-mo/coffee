  "description": "From Sulawesi, the Indonesian island previously known as Celebes, \"Kalossi\" is the former Dutch word for the island. It predates \"Toraja\" as a name for this coffee. The producers in this region have many acceptable conditions for growing coffee like volcanic soil and thick forests for shade that maintain moisture needed for the coffee plants. Small family farms grow and process their own coffee cherries and use the wet hulled process method that leaves the beans exposed while they dry on patios then they are collected and transported to a central dry mill for final preparation, sorting, and exporting. The Kalossi is an outstanding cup for those who like a full-bodied, aromatic, wild and spicy, highly-complex brew, and a little funkier than the Toraja. Compared to the Toraja, the Kalossi picks up some additional earthy character from the additional chaff. Cupping Notes: Clean, sweet, and earthy with a heavy body, low acidity, and notes of pepper and spice- a classic Indonesian coffee. Try before you stock up with a 1/2 pound sample!"
