  "description": "Papua New Guinea coffees are known for their complex acidity and bountiful variety due to cultural and topographical diversity––few plantations are large, and most happen to be small plots. Processing methods are constantly being updated to ensure the best coffee year after year. This specific Arakara AA hails from the Arokara Cooperative, a partner of plantations in the Eastern Highlands of Papua, New Guinea. Recently, the plantations have been transferred to the original owners who believe in a chemical-free production process. The coffee’s cherry is hand-picked by the clan, immediately pulped, and fermented in cement vats for three days. Then, the coffee is washed with the Aru River’s water and sun-dried for seven to twelve days. The plantations hire up to 60 assistants to the clan cherry pickers––nearly 12,000 people depend on this process for income to support their families. Cupping notes: Fruit and sweet floral aroma, dark chocolate, plum, earthy; creamy body, winy acidity. Try before you stock up with a 1/2lb sample!!
