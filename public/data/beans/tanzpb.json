  "description": "This African coffee variety is wild and gamey, the good kind of gamey that tells you this is not a domesticated coffee. This coffee is a blend of various coffee producers from across the Kilimanjaro and Arusha regions. These groups come from districts in Kilimanjaro such as Hai and Moshi Rural district; in addition, the coffee was also sourced from the Meru district close to the town of Arusha. The producers of this coffee have farms between 1-2 hectares in size and intercrop with bananas and avocado. The coffee is fully washed and processed on the farms using locally made hand pulpers and buckets for fermentation and dried on raised beds. \n\nCupping Notes: Sweet brown sugar honey aroma, juicy smooth medium to full body, clean, sweet, fruity lingering aftertaste, exotic well, balanced, intense flavor, and crisp, bright, tangy winey acidity with black tea, citrus, orange, and blueberry notes.\n \n\nTry before you stock up with a 1/2 pound sample!"
