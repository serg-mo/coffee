  "description": "This grade 2 Ethiopian coffee from the Limu region is one of the most interesting coffees we've come across recently, and for an Ethiopian coffee, that's saying something! We cupped one sample and immediately knew we had to bring this one in. \n\n\n\nJimma zone is located to the southwest of Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa. Much of Jimma, like other coffee-growing regions in Ethiopia, is a vast, gently sloping plateau with incredibly fertile soil at high elevations. The top-quality coffees from Jimma, especially those from the Limu, Gera, and Goma districts, are renowned for their vibrant and delicate fruit flavors. The region’s renowned \"white\" honey, collected by bees from the blossoms of coffee plants and the surrounding forests, is a well-known symbol of Jimma and brings immense pleasure to the senses. Coffees from this zone, along with those from the nearby Illubabor region, are often labeled as “Limu”, a distinction based more on terroir and shared flavor profiles rather than geographical boundaries.\n\n\n\nCupping notes: Fruity with lime citrus, herbal, and floral notes. Chocolaty and complex.Try before you stock up with a 1/2lb sample!!"
