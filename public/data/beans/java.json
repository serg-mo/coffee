  "description": "Sourced from small, family-owned farms in the Surya Abadi Kayumas cooperative, this coffee is given its hallmark Indonesian profile through a unique process known as wet-hulling––the coffee parchment is removed before drying is completed. On the island of Java, Indonesia, coffee production is regularly dominated by government-run estates, a hierarchy first established in the 18th century. Be that as it may, this particular bean was refined by only 66 producers with an average farm size of 5 acres. Cupping notes: Cupping notes include black pepper, cedar, dark chocolate. Try before you stock up with a 1/2 pound sample!"
