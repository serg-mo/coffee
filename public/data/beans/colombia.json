  "description": "El Gato Supremo is grown through the Santander Department, which is widely known for its natural, shade-grown coffees. These beans are cultivated in rich forests where volcanic soils, idyllic microclimates, and average temperatures between 68 and 71 degrees Fahrenheit are ideal for growing specialty-grade arabica. A proper 17/18 screen Colombia Supremo green coffee, this bean is handpicked, washed, and milled by the Northeastern Colombian Coffee Cooperative (Cooperativa Cafetera Del Nororiente Colombiano). Cupping Notes: Good medium body, a silky, smooth mouthfeel, mild acidity, and notes of citrus, brown sugar, pecan, fig, red grape, and honey.Try before you stock up with a 1/2 pound sample!"
