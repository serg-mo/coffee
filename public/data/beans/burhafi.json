  "description": "This coffee is called  Hafi, which means “close” in Kirundi. Before the washing station opened, small farmers in the area faced a 20km journey to deliver their freshly harvested cherry to the nearest wet mill. With the hilly terrain, that was too far to travel in one day. Quality standards require same-day processing for harvested cherry. A wet mill nearby makes it possible to grow this specialty coffee we treasure, which features silky smooth notes of sweet, dried cherries and blackberries."
