  "description": "Try this new Ethiopia Shantawene Abore G1 from Sidamo!  This lot comes to us from approximately 500 small speciality coffee farms located 1920-2020 meters above seal level near villages Shantawene, Abore and Bombe. Abore gets its name from a bridge and a fountain located next to the washing station that was originally dedicated to a local chief in the area. Situated near the Bok Nora Waterfall, the Abore washing station is surrounded by vast and huge vegetation. Abore washing station is well known by the locals in the region and popular for its long history. Originally built and founded in 1997, many employees have been working there since it was founded. This is a fully washed process and is dried on raised beds. Cupping notes: Black Tea, Lemongrass, Apricot. Clean and complex, juicy acidity with a sweet finish. Try before you stock up with a 1/2 pound sample!"
