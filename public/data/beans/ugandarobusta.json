  "description": "This premium Ugandan robusta is grown on the Kaweri farm, which cultivates 1,626 hectares of selected Ugandan coffee under indigenous shade trees. The farm produces high-quality, dense, hard beans comparable to high-grown Arabica and is pioneering the washed process for Robusta in Uganda. Their meticulous harvesting and processing methods include selective cherry picking and a thorough post-harvest process involving pulping, soaking, sun pre-drying, and final drum drying.\n\n\nCupping Notes: Peanut, popcorn, salted caramel, vanilla, slightly floral, pear, malty, quick finish, light body."
