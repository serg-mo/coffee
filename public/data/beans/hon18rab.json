  "description": "18 Rabbit––part of Honduras’ Cup of Excellence––is a collection of farms owned by Señora Flhor, her mother, and eleven members of their family. As pioneers of organic and biodynamic coffee-farming techniques, the soil they use is always naturally regenerated. 18 Rabbit Washed coffees are grown in the Marcala region and wash-processed, which gives the roast a sweet flavor.  Cupping Notes: Chocolate and caramel aromas with chocolate flavors and a mild green apple-like acidity with a heavy body and very sweet.Try before you stock up with a 1/2 pound sample!"
