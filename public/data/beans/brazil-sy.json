  "description": "Daterra’s Sweet Yellow has a delightful nutty sweetness expected from a semi-washed bean. Daterra Farms, the bean’s origin, was not only the very first Brazilian farm to achieve Rainforest Alliance certification but the first farm in the world to reach “Level A,” the RFA’s highest possible grading. For decades, Daterra has been protecting flora and fauna, saving and recycling water, and preserving the forests around them. When it comes to sustainability, Daterra Farms is king. Cupping Notes: Medium body, good acidity, and intense sweetness with notes of nut and butter. Try before you stock up with a 1/2 pound sample!"
