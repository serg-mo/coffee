# Coffee

Four regions, five half-pound samples each. Given a fixed roast/grind, rank the beans wihin each region.

Sometimes I screw up the roast and I do not have enough beans to fill the whole matrix.
With pairwise comparisons, I compare each unique pair twice, e.g., a vs b and b vs a.
If the two cells disagree, there is no definite winner and no transitive completeness.
Therefore, I need more than two comparions to save beans and have a definite winner.

Five beans in 10 groups of 3 or 5 groups of 4, both compare each unique pair 3 times.
I like groups of 4 because it's easy to remember: exclude one bean at each tasting.
There is a lot more waste, but I can taste the whole region in a week. Not 5 because
I only have 4 puck screens.

When swapping beans, the puck depth is different, because of bean density.
Maybe i should get one of them puck scrapers, then figure out what it weighs.
i know the exact depth i want, including the puck screen, hence overfill and scrape


## TODO: given 5 sets of 4 ranks, derive the winner of every pairwise comparison (symmetrical)
